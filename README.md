RoboSelf

The objective of the project is the development of A Self-awareness Engine for a Mobile Robot. 
The concrete dimensions of this shall be defined during the project. In principle, the objective 
is to develop a complete self-model of a mobile robot to serve as core resource in a self-awareness 
mechanism to make the robot fully conscious of itself.

The initial idea was to target the Higgs robot, but due to the nature of the project -indeed a bit 
philosophical- we can use another simpler robot to simplify the practical issues. A robot simulation 
may be enough to check the core elements.
